# ðŸ”§ Fixing Current Issues

## Issue 1: MMKV Native Module Error

**Error:** `[Error: Failed to create a new MMKV instance! Make sure you rebuilt the app.]`

**Cause:** MMKV is a native module that requires rebuilding the app after installation.

### Solution:

```bash
# Stop the current dev server (Ctrl+C)

# Clean and prebuild
cd /Users/ayushpersonal/Documents/personal-projects/exp-expo-build-issue/nexus-skeleton
npx expo prebuild --clean

# Rebuild for Android
npm run android

# OR for iOS
npm run ios
```

**Alternative (if prebuild doesn't work):**

```bash
# For Android
cd android
./gradlew clean
cd ..
npm run android

# For iOS
cd ios
rm -rf Pods
pod install
cd ..
npm run ios
```

## Issue 2: Missing Routes Warning

**Warning:** `No route named "gestures" exists in nested children`

**Cause:** Metro bundler cache or dev server needs restart.

### Solution:

```bash
# Clear Metro cache and restart
npx expo start --clear

# Then press 'a' for Android or 'i' for iOS
```

**If that doesn't work:**

```bash
# Delete metro cache manually
rm -rf node_modules/.cache
rm -rf .expo

# Restart dev server
npm start
```

---

## Quick Fix (Do This Now):

**Step 1:** Stop the dev server (Ctrl+C in terminal)

**Step 2:** Run these commands:

```bash
cd /Users/ayushpersonal/Documents/personal-projects/exp-expo-build-issue/nexus-skeleton

# Clean everything
npx expo prebuild --clean

# Clear cache
npx expo start --clear
```

**Step 3:** When Metro is ready, press:
- `a` for Android (or)
- `i` for iOS

**Step 4:** Wait for rebuild to complete

---

## Why This Happens

### Native Modules
Libraries like MMKV, SQLite, Vision Camera, and others require **native code** that must be compiled into your app. Installing them via npm only adds the JavaScript/TypeScript code, but the native iOS/Android code needs to be built.

### Routes Not Found
Expo Router uses the file system for routing. When you add new files, sometimes Metro bundler's cache doesn't pick them up immediately. Clearing the cache fixes this.

---

## After Rebuild

Once the app rebuilds successfully:

1. âœ… All tabs should appear (Home, Tests, Gestures, Camera, Theme, Settings)
2. âœ… MMKV storage will work
3. âœ… All native modules will be functional
4. âœ… Camera will work (on physical device)

---

## Troubleshooting

### If prebuild fails:

```bash
# Remove existing native folders
rm -rf android ios

# Prebuild again
npx expo prebuild
```

### If Android build fails:

```bash
cd android
./gradlew clean
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

### If iOS build fails:

```bash
cd ios
pod deintegrate
pod install
cd ..
npx expo run:ios
```

### If routes still missing:

1. Check files exist: `ls app/(tabs)/`
2. Should see: `gestures.tsx`, `camera.tsx`, `theme-demo.tsx`
3. Restart Metro with `--clear` flag
4. Try restarting computer if Metro cache persists

---

## Expected Timeline

- **Prebuild:** 2-3 minutes
- **Android build:** 3-5 minutes (first time)
- **iOS build:** 4-6 minutes (first time)
- **Subsequent builds:** 1-2 minutes

---

## Verify Success

After rebuild, you should see:

```
âœ… App starts without errors
âœ… 6 tabs visible in tab bar
âœ… Tests tab loads without MMKV error
âœ… Can navigate to all tabs
âœ… No route warnings in console
```

---

## Need Help?

If issues persist:

1. Share the full error message
2. Note which step failed
3. Check if it's a simulator or physical device
4. Try on opposite platform (iOS vs Android)

---

**TL;DR:** Run these commands:

```bash
# Stop dev server (Ctrl+C)
npx expo prebuild --clean
npm run android
```

That's it! ðŸš€
