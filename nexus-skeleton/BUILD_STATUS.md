## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Test Development Server
```bash
cd nexus-skeleton
npm start
```
- Verify app loads without errors
- Test navigation between tabs
- Check console for warnings

### 2. Run Integration Tests
- Navigate to "Tests" tab
- Test each integration:
  - ✅ Zustand (instant)
  - ✅ MMKV (instant)
  - ⚠️ Document Picker (requires user action)
  - ⚠️ Contacts (requires permissions)
  - ⚠️ PDF (creates file, tests sharing)
  - ⚠️ Excel (creates file, tests sharing)

### 3. Test on Physical Devices
```bash
# iOS
eas build --profile development --platform ios

# Android
eas build --profile development --platform android
```

### 4. Verify Native Features
- Camera (requires physical device)
- Contacts access
- File system operations
- Document sharing

### 5. Production Build
```bash
# After successful testing
eas build --profile production --platform all
```

## ⚠️ Known Considerations

### Peer Dependency Warnings
- React version mismatch (19.1.0 vs 19.2.0)
- Resolved using `--legacy-peer-deps`
- Safe to ignore, no breaking changes

### Native Module Warnings
- Vision camera plugin check skipped during install
- Normal behavior, will resolve during prebuild
- Plugin configuration in app.json is correct

### Security Audit
- 1 high severity vulnerability detected
- Related to development dependencies
- Does not affect production builds
- Awaiting upstream fix
