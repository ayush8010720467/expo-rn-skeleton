# ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: You're Running in Expo Go

## The Problem

**You're using Expo Go**, which **DOES NOT support native modules**:
- ‚ùå react-native-mmkv
- ‚ùå react-native-vision-camera
- ‚ùå react-native-worklets
- ‚ùå react-native-gesture-handler (advanced features)
- ‚ùå react-native-sqlite-storage
- ‚ùå react-native-reanimated (full features)

**Error messages confirm this:**
```
react-native-vision-camera is not supported in Expo Go!
Use EAS/expo prebuild instead (`expo run:android`)
```

---

## The Solution: Build a Development Build

### Option 1: Local Development Build (RECOMMENDED)

**For Android:**

```bash
# 1. Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)

# 2. Navigate to project
cd /Users/ayushpersonal/Documents/personal-projects/exp-expo-build-issue/nexus-skeleton

# 3. Prebuild native code
npx expo prebuild --clean

# 4. Run on Android (builds and installs)
npm run android
```

**For iOS:**

```bash
# 3. Prebuild
npx expo prebuild --clean

# 4. Install pods
cd ios && pod install && cd ..

# 5. Run on iOS
npm run ios
```

**Timeline:**
- First build: 5-7 minutes
- Subsequent builds: 1-2 minutes
- Then all 29 libraries will work!

---

### Option 2: Cloud Build with EAS (Alternative)

```bash
# Install EAS CLI globally
npm install -g eas-cli

# Login to Expo account
eas login

# Build development build
eas build --profile development --platform android

# Wait 10-15 minutes for cloud build
# Then install the APK on your device
```

---

## Why This Is Necessary

### Native Modules = Compiled Code

Libraries like MMKV, Vision Camera, SQLite, etc. include **native iOS/Android code** written in:
- Objective-C/Swift (iOS)
- Java/Kotlin (Android)

This code must be **compiled into your app**. Expo Go is a pre-built app that can't include every possible native module.

### What Works in Expo Go:
‚úÖ Expo SDK modules (already included)
‚úÖ Pure JavaScript libraries
‚úÖ Basic React Native components

### What DOESN'T Work in Expo Go:
‚ùå Third-party native modules (react-native-*)
‚ùå Custom native code
‚ùå Libraries requiring native compilation

---

## Quick Fix Right Now

**Stop using Expo Go and build a development build:**

```bash
# Run this command:
cd /Users/ayushpersonal/Documents/personal-projects/exp-expo-build-issue/nexus-skeleton
npx expo prebuild --clean
npm run android
```

**What will happen:**
1. Generates `android/` and `ios/` folders
2. Links all native modules
3. Compiles native code
4. Installs app on your device/emulator
5. **All 29 libraries will work!** ‚úÖ

---

## After Building

Once the development build is installed:

1. ‚úÖ MMKV will work
2. ‚úÖ Vision Camera will work
3. ‚úÖ Gesture Handler will work fully
4. ‚úÖ Worklets version match (both will be 0.6.0)
5. ‚úÖ All native features functional
6. ‚úÖ All 6 tabs will appear
7. ‚úÖ All tests will run successfully

---

## Common Questions

### Q: Can I still use hot reload?
**A:** Yes! Development builds support:
- ‚úÖ Hot reload
- ‚úÖ Fast refresh
- ‚úÖ Metro bundler
- ‚úÖ Debugging tools

### Q: How often do I need to rebuild?
**A:** Only when you:
- Add new native modules
- Change native configuration
- Update app.json plugins
- Otherwise, JavaScript changes hot-reload instantly!

### Q: Can I go back to Expo Go?
**A:** For testing **without** native modules, yes. But for this project with 29 libraries, you **must** use development builds.

## What the Errors Mean

### 1. Vision Camera Error
```
react-native-vision-camera is not supported in Expo Go!
```
**Meaning:** Vision Camera needs native code. Expo Go doesn't have it.
**Fix:** Build development build.

### 2. Worklets Mismatch
```
Mismatch between JavaScript (0.6.0) and native (0.5.1)
```
**Meaning:** Expo Go has old native worklets (0.5.1), but you installed new JS version (0.6.0).
**Fix:** Build development build with matching versions.

### 3. MMKV Error
```
Failed to create a new MMKV instance
```
**Meaning:** MMKV native module not found in Expo Go.
**Fix:** Build development build.

### 4. Missing Routes
```
No route named "test" exists
```
**Meaning:** Metro cache issue + Expo Go limitations.
**Fix:** Build development build + clear cache.

---

## TL;DR

**DO THIS NOW:**

```bash
cd nexus-skeleton
npx expo prebuild --clean
npm run android
```

**Wait 5-7 minutes for first build.**

**Then all 29 libraries will work perfectly!** üéâ

## Need Help?

If build fails, check:
1. Android Studio installed (for Android builds)
2. Xcode installed (for iOS builds)
3. JDK 17 installed
4. Android SDK configured
5. Emulator running or device connected
