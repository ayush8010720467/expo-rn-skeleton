## 🎓 What You Learned

### Why It Works Now:

**Before:**
- ❌ Running in Expo Go (no native modules)
- ❌ Wrong package versions
- ❌ Worklets version mismatch
- ❌ Missing babel preset

**After:**
- ✅ Development build (native code included)
- ✅ Correct Expo SDK 54 versions
- ✅ Worklets 0.5.1 (matched)
- ✅ Complete babel configuration

### Key Takeaways:

1. **Native modules need dev builds** (not Expo Go)
2. **Package versions must match Expo SDK**
3. **Prebuild generates native code**
4. **First build takes time, then it's fast**

---

## 💡 Quick Tips

### For Future Development:

**When to rebuild:**
- Adding new native modules
- Changing app.json plugins
- Updating native dependencies

**No rebuild needed for:**
- JavaScript/TypeScript changes (hot reload)
- UI updates
- Logic changes
- Most code changes

**Commands to remember:**
```bash
# Start dev server
npm start

# Clear cache if needed
npx expo start --clear

# Rebuild if adding native modules
npx expo prebuild --clean
npm run android
```
